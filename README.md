# Project Description

Our teamâ€™s web application aims to enable musicians to buy and sell equipment, facilitating a direct connection and trade among them. We envision several key features for our platform:

- A user account system.
- The ability for users to post instruments for sale and purchase them.
- A messaging system for buyers to contact sellers.
- A liking system for users to save postings they are interested in.
- The ability for users to review others who have sold products.
- A potential tracking system for monitoring the delivery of orders.
